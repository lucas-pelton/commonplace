Cecil Paul is an elder of the Killer Whale Clan of the Henaaksiala people. Born and raised in the Kitlope, Cecil was taken to residential school when he was ten. He was a key player in the fight to preserve the Kitlope Heritage Conservancy—now the largest intact temperate rainforest on the planet. Cecil was also instrumental in the long search for the G’psgoalux pole taken from the Kitlope estuary in the early 1900s and returned to his people in 2006. A leader in his community, Cecil teaches the youth of Kitamaat about the Huchsduwachsdu (Gardner Canal), Kemaano, and the Kitlope.
