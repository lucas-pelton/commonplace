Ivan Thompson first saw the Skeena on a perfectly sunny fall day, coming up over Hungry Hill to take in the autumn colors of the Babine Mountains. He dropped into Smithers and browsed through a local bookstore, with its vast array of picture and history books. “I thought if a town this small has this many great publications about the place and the people that live here, there must be something cool going on,” he says. “It was a rare moment of clear decision in life—especially in my 20s.”

He taught science at a local high school, and wasn’t looking to get into activism, but then he learned of plans to log up to the tree line in some of the valleys in the Babine. Thompson and a small group of citizens created a local organization called the Driftwood Foundation, then the Bulkley Valley Resources Board (a forum for community planning), and finally a land use plan for the Bulkley Forest District that, among other things, protected the Babine Mountains. That served as his introduction to the world of conservation. 

After moving up to the college level to teach natural resource management and natural sciences he began work in 2002 as the Community Economic Advisor on the Great Bear Initiative, an international effort to responsibly manage 24 million acres of the lower Skeena country, coastal islands, and fjords stretching south along the coast of British Columbia. 

Thompson has since joined the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, overseeing the work it supports throughout the Skeena region. “I’ve never lost my sense that the power to stop change, or keep change from happening too rapidly or randomly, comes from people with a passion for place,” Thompson says. “I’m not saying there aren’t other forms of power or they are less effective or important. I’m just saying this is the one I understand because, quite simply, that’s where I came from.”
